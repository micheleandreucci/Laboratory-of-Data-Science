With respect to the first part of this project, our goals are:
1.	Create our own Database Schema from a reference figure given by the assignment using SQL Server Management Studio.

2.	Write a python program that splits tennis.csv file into 4 chunks of different csv files with their proper names: “match”, “player”, “tournament”, “date” and retrieving the feature “sex” from male_players.csv and female_players.csv. These two tasks had to be accomplished without using pandas library.

3.	Write a Python program that populates our database with the various tables from the .csv files, establishing schema relations as necessary.
